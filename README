swo-tracer - simple watcher and parser for ARM SWO trace output.

Usage:

To parse a file's contents and watch that file for further trace data:

$ swo-tracer <file_path>

To only watch for new data (anything in the file prior to running swo-tracer
will be lost), supply the -t option:

$ swo-tracer -t <file_path>

Press control+c to stop the program.

Output:

At this time, swo-tracer will output:
- the byte as an ASCII character for 1-byte fields, ex: c
- the value in hex for 2-byte fields, ex: [0xFE]
- the value in hex for 4-byte fields, ex: [0xFEED]
